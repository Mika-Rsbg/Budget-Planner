# Security Guidelines

## Important Notice

This project currently does not focus on issuing active security patches or running an extensive security monitoring program. While every effort is made to ensure that our releases are as secure as possible, we **cannot guarantee absolute security**. We recommend that users take appropriate measures to secure their own deployments.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please use our dedicated Security Issue Template in the GitHub Issue Tracker to report it. This helps us gather all the necessary details for evaluation.

When filing a report, please include:
- **Description:** A clear explanation of the vulnerability.
- **Reproduction Steps:** Detailed instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
- **Environment:** Information about the setup (e.g., OS, software version, configuration).
- **Additional Information:** Any logs, screenshots, or other details that might assist in addressing the issue.

## Security Issue Template

You can report security issues by using our [Security Issue Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security_en.md). This template is designed to help you include all necessary details so that we can assess the situation appropriately.

## Disclaimer

All releases are built with security in mind, and we strive to make them as robust as possible. However, we cannot promise that every vulnerability has been identified or addressed. Users are responsible for maintaining their own security.
