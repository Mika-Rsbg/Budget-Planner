## Our Pledge

In the interest of having and supporting an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism:** Focus on mutual growth and continuous improvement.
- **Focusing on what is best for the community:** Help build a productive and cooperative community.
- **Demonstrating empathy towards other community members:** Practice kindness and understanding in all interactions.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you encounter or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please follow these steps:
1. **Report the behavior:** Contact a community moderator or the project maintainers. Provide as many details as possible—including dates, descriptions, and any relevant context.
2. **Direct Communication:** When appropriate, consider addressing the issue directly with the person involved; however, your safety and comfort are the priority.
3. **Confidentiality:** Reports will be handled confidentially. All reports will be taken seriously and examined promptly.

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the project community. Decisions regarding enforcement will be made by the project maintainers or designated community leaders.
