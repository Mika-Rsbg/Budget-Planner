## üéØ Project Overview

Budget Planner is a Python GUI application built with Tkinter that provides comprehensive budget tracking and financial management capabilities. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation between GUI, data handling, and business logic.

### Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with base classes and plugins
- **Plugin System**: Extensible design allowing new features without core modifications  
- **Database Integration**: SQLite database with proper schema and foreign key relationships
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Multi-level logging with decorators for debugging and monitoring
- **Responsive GUI**: Tkinter-based interface with consistent styling and layout

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter with ttk styling
- **Database**: SQLite with foreign key constraints
- **Architecture Pattern**: Plugin-based modular design
- **Logging**: Python's built-in logging module with custom decorators

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

The application is structured around several key architectural patterns:

1. **Base Window Classes**: `BaseWindow` (main windows) and `BaseToplevelWindow` (dialogs) provide consistent behavior
2. **Plugin System**: Dynamic loading of plugins with naming convention `plugin_{scope}_{type}_{name}.py`
3. **Database Layer**: Singleton connection pattern with utility modules organized by domain
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
5. **Logging Strategy**: Decorator-based logging with multiple output targets and rotation

## üë• Contributing
